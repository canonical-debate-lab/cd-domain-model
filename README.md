# Canonical Debate Domain Model

The domain model for the Canonical Debate in various programming languages and formats:

- [Kotlin Multiplatform](./cd-domain-model-kotlin): written in Kotlin, creating libraries for both the JVM and JS runtime. Supports JSON serialization.

Currently these are still work in progress. As we discuss and align on definitions in [our shared glossary in the Canonical Debate Lab](https://trello.com/b/LRMTbAfJ/argumentation-glossary-ubiquitous-language) we aim to incorporate new implied requirements into the domain model implementations listed above.
